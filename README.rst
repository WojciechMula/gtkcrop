                        GTK: select portion of image
================================================================================

Status: under development

This is an extremely simple GUI, that allows a user select portion of an
image and finally save or print the selected rectangle.

My use case is a photo gallery: I have got some pictures which just need
a cropping.  The output from this program will be used as a parameter for
external tools that do scaling and other web-related things.

Of course, I could crop images using GIMP (or similar program), but then
I need to store the output somewhere for further use. And I would do this
if I had few cases like that.
